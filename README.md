# Crunchbase News

The Crunchbase News Gem is designed to extract news articles from news.crunchbase.com, page by page. 

The scraper automatically extracts the latest 10 pages of news articles and stores them. It retrieves whichever page of the 10 pages the user specifies and returns a list of articles with the article number, title, date and authors(s) provided. The user can select whether they would like to read any of the articles in further detail by specifying the article number to see the content of the article.
